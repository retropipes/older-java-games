<p class="p1"><strong>WidgetWarren Help</strong>

  <p class="p2">Version 1.0.0 - Last Updated June 7, 2014

  <p class="p3"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Game Objective</em></strong>

  <p class="p5">The overall goal of the game is to find and enter the finish for the particular Maze being solved. Since you can make your own Mazes, the exact way this is accomplished differs from Maze to Maze.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Term Definitions</em></strong>

  <p class="p5">Rows and Columns refer to the horizontal and vertical lines of squares making up the Maze Grid. Floors are stacks of Row/Column Grids. Levels are stacks of Floors. Finally, every Maze has 2 Layers - the Ground Layer (where Grass, Tile, and other types of ground belong) and the Object Layer (where everything else belongs). Levels in a maze file are treated as distinct Mazes in their own right, with individual start points and finishes.

  <p class="p7"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Menu Overview</em></strong>

  <p class="p5"><strong>File</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>New</em>: Creates a new Maze. You can specify its dimensions. Rows and Columns cannot be less than 2 squares nor greater than 64 squares, and Floors not less than 1 nor greater than 64. A new Maze always starts with 1 Level - more can be added later.

  <p class="p5"><em>Open…</em>: Opens an existing Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Open Locked…</em>: Opens an existing Maze that has been locked with the <em>Save Locked...</em> command.

  <p class="p5"><em>Close</em>: Closes the current Mode Window (Game or Editor, not the current Maze).

  <p class="p5"><em>Save</em>: Saves the current Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Save As</em>: Saves the current Maze with a new name.

  <p class="p5"><em>Save Locked...</em>: Saves a locked copy of the current Maze. Locked Mazes may not be edited.

  <p class="p5"><em>Exit</em> (non-Mac OS X platforms only): Quits the Program. (On Mac OS X, the Quit WidgetWarren command in the WidgetWarren menu does the same thing.)

  <p class="p5"><strong>Edit</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>Undo</em>: Undoes the most recent action. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Redo</em>: Redoes the most recent action. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Cut Level</em>: Copies the active Level to the internal clipboard, then removes the Level. Not available if the active Maze has only one Level in it. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Copy Level</em>: Copies the active Level to the internal clipboard. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Paste Level</em>: Pastes the clipboard contents into the active Level, overwriting whatever is there, and then redraws the Editor. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Insert Level From Clipboard</em>: Pastes the clipboard contents into a new Level, appending it to the end of the Maze. This command is available only in the Editor.<em>Preferences</em>: Allows configuration of various Game and Editor Settings. (On Mac OS X, this command is in the WidgetWarren Menu.)

  <p class="p5"><em>Clear History</em>: Clears the Undo/Redo History, prompting for confirmation first. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Play</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>Play</em>: Allows solving the current Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Edit</em>: Allows modifying the current Maze. Note that invoking the Editor after opening a Saved Game will cause the Saved State to be lost.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Game</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>Show Inventory</em>: Shows all Items you are carrying. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Use an Item...</em>: Allows using anything you're carrying that can be explicitly used. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Switch Bow…</em>: Allows changing which bow of the ones you possess arrows should be shot from. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Reset Current Level</em>: Resets the current Level of the Maze you're solving to its unsolved state. This is handy if you get stuck. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Show Current Score</em>: Displays how many Steps you've taken so far to solve this Maze. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><em>Show Score Table</em>: Displays the 10 best Scores for this Maze. If no Scores have been recorded yet, all the Names and Scores will have default values. This command is only available while solving a Maze.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Editor</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>Go To Location…</em>: Prompts for a location, then moves the Editor view to be centered on that location.

  <p class="p5"><em>Go To Destination…</em>: Prompts for a click on a Teleport, then moves the Editor view to be centered on its destination, and draws a destination object at that location, which vanishes as soon as the Editor is redrawn. This command only works on objects with fixed destinations, such as Teleports, Invisible Teleports, One-Shot Teleports, and Invisible One-Shot Teleports. Invoking it on an object with a variable destination, such as a set of stairs, any of the Random Teleports, a Pit, or a Springboard, will not work.

  <p class="p5"><em>Up One Floor</em>, <em>Down One Floor</em>, <em>Up One Level</em>, <em>Down One Level, Add a Level..., Remove a Level...</em>: All these commands work only in the Editor, and are self-explanatory.

  <p class="p5"><em>Resize Current Level</em>: Changes the size of the active Level within the active Maze. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Toggle Layer</em>: Switches between Ground Layer and Object Layer views. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Level Preferences...</em>: Opens the Level Preferences dialog, where settings specific to the active Level of the current Maze can be set. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Maze Preferences...</em>: Opens the Maze Preferences dialog, where settings specific to the current Maze as a whole can be set. This command is available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Set Start Point…</em>: Prompts for a click to set the start point, then moves the Player (if it exists) to that location. This command is available only when the Editor is active, and it is editing the Object Layer. If an attempt is made to set the start point outside the bounds of the Maze, the message "Aim within the maze" will display in the Message Area, and the action will be aborted.

  <p class="p5"><em>Set First Moving Finish…</em>: Prompts for a click to set the location of the first moving finish to activate, then sets the location to the spot clicked on. This command is available only when the Editor is active.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Editor: Fill sub-menu</strong>

  <p class="p5">Note: The first four of the commands in this section are available only in the Editor, can not be undone, and will clear the undo/redo history. The remaining two are available only in the Editor.

  <p class="p5"><em>Fill Active Floor</em>: Fills the active Floor with the default fill chosen in the the Preferences.

  <p class="p5"><em>Fill Active Level</em>: Fills the active Level with the default fill chosen in the the Preferences.

  <p class="p5"><em>Fill Active Floor Randomly</em>: Fills the active Floor with randomly chosen Objects.

  <p class="p5"><em>Fill Active Level Randomly</em>: Fills the active Level with randomly chosen Objects.

  <p class="p5"><em>Fill Rule Sets…</em>: Opens the Rule Set Picker, where Rule Sets can be defined, created, destroyed, saved, and loaded. Rule Sets influence the random Maze generator.

  <p class="p5"><em>Use Fill Rule Sets</em>: This setting controls whether or not Rule Sets defined are used in random Maze generation. It is checked if it is active, and its value is not saved between program runs.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Help</strong>

  <p class="p5"><em>About WidgetWarren...</em>: Displays the Game's About Box. (On Mac OS X, this command is in the WidgetWarren Menu.)

  <p class="p5"><em>WidgetWarren Object Help</em>: Displays a window listing all the Objects and a short description of what each one does.

  <p class="p7"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Preferences Overview</em></strong>

  <p class="p5">The Preferences are divided into three tabs: <em>Editor</em>, <em>Sound,</em> and <em>Misc</em>. <em>Editor</em> and <em>Sound</em> are for Editor-related and sound-related settings, respectively. The <em>Misc.</em> tab has one setting: whether or not to operate in One Move at a Time mode.

  <p class="p7"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Controls in the Game</em></strong>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Moving Around and Identifying Objects</strong>

  <p class="p5">To move, use the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, and Right. You can also use the Numeric Keypad. Adding modifier keys (Shift or Control/Command/Windows) to pressing the arrow keys enables diagonal movement. If you wish to move diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or modifiers with the arrow keys are the only ways to do this. Shift+Click an object to identify it. Its name will be displayed in the Message Area. If, for some reason, you need to make a "pass move" - that is, a do-nothing move, pressing 5 on the Numeric Keypad or Shift + the Enter/Return key achieves this.

  <p class="p5"><strong>Note:</strong> Shift as a modifier rotates the arrow keys 45 degrees clockwise; Control/Command/Windows as a modifier rotates the arrow keys 45 degrees counter-clockwise.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Your Health</strong>

  <p class="p5">In addition to simply trying to find the exit, managing your Health must be done as well. Should you run out for any reason, your game will end. Many things affect your Health, both good and bad. Worse still, the very air in these Mazes is poisonous. The poison will slowly weaken you as you walk around the maze. Its power is displayed in the stats area at the top. If the poison power is None, then there is no poison. Otherwise, it is displayed in units of health taken away per number of steps.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Time Limits</strong>

  <p class="p5">There may be a time limit, measured in steps, for how long you can take to solve this Level of this Maze. If time runs out, you will be sent back to where you began this level.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Shooting Arrows</strong>

  <p class="p5">To shoot, hold down Alt/Option then use the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, and Right, use the Numeric Keypad, or the WAXD layout. If you wish to shoot diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or WAXD are the only ways to do this. Various Objects react to getting hit by arrows. You have an unlimited supply of regular arrows. Be careful - if you accidentally shoot yourself with your own arrows, you'll suffer a little damage. This damage is doubled for enchanted arrows.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Shooting Enchanted Arrows</strong>

  <p class="p5">First, activate the enchanted bow you wish to use by choosing <em>Switch Bow…</em> from the Game menu. Arrows you shoot will come from the bow you just activated, until you switch again or run out of arrows. Enchanted bows only come with a limited arrow supply, unlike your regular bow.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Pushing and Pulling</strong>

  <p class="p5">To push an Object, just move into it. It will also move, if it can. To pull an Object, hold Shift and move AWAY from it. It will follow you, if it can be pulled.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Seeing what you are carrying</strong>

  <p class="p5">To see what Items (if any) you have in your possession, choose <em>Show Inventory</em> from the <em>Game</em> menu. A dialog box will appear, listing everything you can carry and what quantity you have.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Using Items you are carrying</strong>

  <p class="p5">To use something you're carrying that can be explicitly used (such as a Wand), choose <em>Use an Item...</em> from the <em>Game</em> Menu. This will bring up a dialog listing what usable Items you have, as well as their quantities and uses - choose which one to use and click the <em>OK</em> button. A prompt will appear in the Message Area at the top: "<em>Click to set target</em>". Click the square in the Maze where you wish the Item's effect to occur, and it will be activated. If you realize you didn't want to use something after all, press <em>Escape</em>, and the action will be cancelled. If you try to use an Item but fail (for example, because the requirements for the target square were not met), a message will appear in the Message Area indicating what went wrong. Not all Items can be explicitly used in this way. Items that show up in the Inventory Dialog but not in the Use Dialog are used automatically when needed.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Effects</strong>

  <p class="p5">Various Objects in the Maze give effects when stepped on or picked up. These effects, along with their durations, will be displayed in the bottom pane. If no effects are currently active, the bottom pane will be collapsed. Effects can be either beneficial or detrimental.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Getting Help</strong>

  <p class="p5">To find out what all the Objects do, choose <em>WidgetWarren Object Help</em> from the <em>Help</em> menu. This will bring up a window that you can leave open while playing the game, listing each object and a short description of how it works. This manual can also be invoked in the game at any time, by choosing <em>WidgetWarren Help</em> from the <em>Help</em> menu.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p4"><strong><em>Controls in the Editor</em></strong>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Moving Around and Identifying Objects</strong>

  <p class="p5">To move the view around, drag the scroll bars on the left. To see more Objects to place, drag the scroll bars on the right. To change Floors and/or Levels, use the <em>Up One Floor</em>, <em>Up One Level</em>, <em>Down One Floor</em>, and <em>Down One Level</em> items in the <em>Edit</em> menu. Shift+Click an object in the maze to identify it. Its name, along with any additional properties it has and the values of those properties, will be displayed in the Message Area.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Placing Objects</strong>

  <p class="p5">To place an Object, first select one in the right pane. Then, click the location in the Maze where you want the Object to go. If you need to change layers in order to place Objects, this can be done via the <em>Toggle Layer</em> option in the Editor menu.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Modifying The Maze Dimensions</strong>

  <p class="p5">Mazes can gain or lose Levels as they are edited. To add a new Level to a Maze, choose <em>Add a Level...</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu. You will be prompted for the dimensions of the new Level. Likewise, removing Levels can be accomplished via the <em>Remove a Level...</em> item in the Edit menu. You'll be prompted for the Level number to remove. Note that if you remove the current Level, you'll be sent to Level 1. The active Level can be resized, too - via the <em>Resize Current Level…</em> option in the Editor menu. Note that resizing a Level affects ALL Floors of that Level.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Setting Object Properties</strong>

  <p class="p5">To set the properties of an Object, if it has any, hold the Option (or Alt) key and click the Object in the Maze Pane on the left. If it has properties you can set, a dialog or a message will appear. If it has no properties, the message "<em>This object has no properties</em>" will appear in the Message Area. Most Teleports will generate a message that says "<em>Click to set destination</em>" - this is exactly like using an Item. Click the spot where you want the destination to be. If you'd like the destination to be on a Floor other than the current one, you can change Floors before clicking. Random Teleports will generate a dialog asking for the Random Row and Column radii. Pressing <em>Escape</em> will cancel setting properties.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Setting Maze and Level Preferences</strong>

  <p class="p5">To set preferences for a Level, or the entire Maze, select the <em>Level Preferences…</em> or <em>Maze Preferences…</em> commands from the Editor menu, as appropriate. Levels have several settings, including wraparound, a title, messages, poison power, and a time limit. Mazes also have several settings, including the Level to start at, a title, and messages.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Defining Rule Sets</strong>

  <p class="p5">Rule Sets influence how the random Maze generator generates mazes. They are managed from the Rule Set Picker. To use the Rule Set Picker, select an Object to work with from the pick list, then click the button for the action desired. Five actions are defined: Create, Destroy, Edit, Load, and Save. Load and Save operate on the entire set, while Create, Destroy, and Edit operate on individual rules. Rules can specify various restrictions on how many Objects should be generated of a specific type, and can also make the Object the Rule acts on required or not required.

  <p class="p5"><strong>V5.00 (07/01/2010):</strong>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Added 8 new objects: Sun Stones, used as triggers for the auto-finish feature (described later); True Sight Amulets, which let you see things as they really are for 30 steps; Springboards, which behave like the opposite of a Pit (send you up a floor instead of down a floor); Invisible Springboards (which behave like Springboards, except they can't be seen); Light Gems, which bathe the immediate area around them in permanent light; Dark Gems, which shroud the immediate area around them in permanent darkness; Light Wands, which create Light Gems if used on an empty space, and destroy Dark Gems if used on them; and Dark Wands, which create Dark Gems if used on an empty space, and destroy Light Gems if used on them.

    <li class="li5">Added a new auto-finish feature. This is configured in the Level Preferences for each level of the Maze, in the Editor. Auto-finish kicks in if it is enabled and enough Sun Stones to meet or exceed the threshold have been collected.

    <li class="li5">The program now remembers the last folder and last filter used independently for all three open dialogs.

    <li class="li5">Made it possible for the next Level for the current Level of a Maze to be something other than the one next in the Level sequence. This can be configured in the Level Preferences, and can be set to a relative or absolute number. Older Mazes default to relative +1 (the next Level in the sequence), so they still work.

    <li class="li5">Improved the default logic for the random Maze generator, to dramatically increase the chances of it generating a solvable Maze.

    <li class="li5">Improved the appearance of the Player image.
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Bug Fixes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">The native format for Mazes in this version is now an enhanced version of the XML format introduced in V4.10 and improved in V4.20. Older Mazes will still work. Older Saved Games will NOT work.

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">The active effects display has been improved. It now has just enough spaces for the maximum number of effects that can be active at once, and automatically compacts itself as effects expire.

    <li class="li5">Plugins can now be unloaded without a program restart.

    <li class="li5">The plugin registration interface got an update: now, the plugins in the Plugins folder are listed in the registration dialog, instead of having to type the name of the desired plugin.
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Bug Fixes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Fixed a preferences bug causing the defaults for sound and music to be set incorrectly.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a preferences bug causing the preferences user interface to not reflect the settings in the preferences file initially.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a preferences bug causing the case where no preference file could be found to not be handled properly.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug with the Ghost Amulet and Passwall Boots causing these objects to automatically open locked objects without a key, instead of simply letting you pass through them.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug in the plugin unregistration interface that caused the plugin registry to be updated with invalid data when more than one plugin was registered.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug causing the timer to not be reset when the maze was reset.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug with the Normal Amulet causing it to not properly deactivate all other amulet effects.
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Other Changes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Some elements of the game GUI have been shuffled. The message display is now above the main Maze view, the effects display is now below the main Maze view, and the stats display is now to the right.

    <li class="li5">To be consistent with the new game GUI arrangement, the message display for the editor has been moved from the bottom to the top.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a typographical issue with the version history for version 4.00.

    <li class="li5">Moved the plugin registry file to a per-user location, instead of the Plugins folder, to make the program behave better in situations where the program's main folder is not writable.

    <li class="li5">Invisible Walls now block passage all the time, even when Passwall Boots or a Ghost Amulet is worn, due to their magic. They also now block Ghost Arrows from passing through.
  </ul>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>V4.20 (06/05/2010):</strong>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>V4.00 (05/26/2010):</strong>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Added 20 new objects: Crumbling Walls, which crumble to nothing when hit; Stumps, which block movement but not arrows, the Ghost Bow, which fires Ghost Arrows; Ghost Arrows pass through any object that does not react to arrows, even if that object is solid!; 3 kinds of hourglass, which extend the time limit to solve the active Level of the active Maze, if a time limit is defined; 5 kinds of amulets, which grant a special ability for 30 steps; a Normal Amulet, which removes any active amulet effect; 3 kinds of boots, granting the same abilities as 3 of the amulets, but lasting until you change boots; 4 kinds of gems, which all add varying amounts to your score; and Hot Rock, a new kind of ground.

    <li class="li5">Added a Convert... menu item for converting Mazes that predate Mazer5D to a format Mazer5D understands. After a Maze is converted, it can be played or edited as normal. If errors are detected during the conversion process (which will happen if objects are defined in the older Maze that don't exist in Mazer5D), the fact that errors were found will be reported when conversion completes.

    <li class="li5">Added time limit support to Mazes. If time runs out, the level will be automatically solved.

    <li class="li5">In certain situations the game window could pop up when it wasn't supposed to. Fixed.

    <li class="li5">Finishes To were not behaving properly when converted in an older Maze, nor were they well-behaved in the Editor. Both problems have been fixed.

    <li class="li5">Finishes were behaving oddly when attempting to set their properties - they don't have any, but the Editor thought they did. Fixed.
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Other Changes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Modified the behavior of the Damaged Wall - it now turns into a Crumbling Wall, instead of vanishing, when hit.

    <li class="li5">Altered the way your score is computed. It is now measured in points, instead of steps; doing various things in the maze affects your score.

    <li class="li5">The Maze format has been updated from version 2.0 to version 3.0. The new version includes support for the new objects and the time limit. The extension is the same as before. Older Mazes will still work. Newer Mazes will NOT work in older versions.

    <li class="li5">The GrayscaleGraphics plugin got updated, due to the addition of new objects. The older plugin will no longer work.
  </ul>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>V3.00 (04/01/2010):</strong>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Dramatically increased the maximum size of a maze, from 64 rows by 64 columns by 8 floors by 8 levels by 2 layers to 64 rows by 64 columns by 64 floors by 2,000,000+ levels by 2 layers.

    <li class="li5">Added support for messages to display for the start and end of each level and maze, as well as titles for each level and maze.

    <li class="li5">Added poisonous level support to mazes. Each level can have its own poison power setting. Poison will slowly deplete your health, if it is activated. The smaller the poison power, the more potent the poison.

    <li class="li5">Added icons for the stat display.

    <li class="li5">Added 33 new objects: 29 kinds of crystal; a Crystal Wall that can be programmed to accept any crystal, or a specific kind of crystal, and otherwise behaves like a lock; Shock Arrows, Shock Bombs, and Shocked Barrier Generators, which behave similarly to their Enraged/Fire counterparts.

    <li class="li5">Added resource override support to the plug-in system.
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Bug Fixes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Re-added the VPlug and VPort objects, after discovering that they had accidentally been deleted in a prior release. Oops!

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug that caused the program to crash when the Set Start Point command was invoked and the start point was set outside the maze.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bunch of potential null pointer access bugs.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a minor bug with multiple actions being fired when not strictly needed.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug in the updater that caused the cache to be updated but never used.

    <li class="li5">Made the special Barrier Generators (Enraged, Iced, Poisoned, and Shocked) place-able in the Maze Editor, to fix a bug that caused these objects to not be recognized if they were present in a saved state.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug causing Remote Action Wands not to work on Barrier Generators.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug causing Invisible Pits not to play a sound when stumbled into, even if sounds were enabled.

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Other Changes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Sadly, due to the new objects introduced, compatibility with V1.0 and V1.1 saved games is no longer possible.

    <li class="li5">The maze format has been updated from version 1.1 to version 2.0. The new version includes support for the increased limits, the new messages, and poison. Older mazes will still work - however, only version 1.1 mazes work. Version 1.0 mazes and saved games are no longer supported. A maze updater is provided to update any version 1.0 mazes to version 1.1, so that they can still be used. Saved games cannot be updated with this tool.

    <li class="li5">Removed a bunch of code that wasn't used anywhere.

    <li class="li5">Removed the Fill Entire Maze commands, because they no longer work properly with the new maze format.

    <li class="li5">Split the Maze Preferences into two: the new Maze Preferences contains settings for the whole maze, and the new Level Preferences contains settings for the active level.

    <li class="li5">Changed plugin unregistration a bit. Now, if no plugins are registered, the program will display a dialog indicating this, instead of presenting an input dialog with "No Plugins Registered" as the only choice.

    <li class="li5">Changed several sound effects used in the game.

    <li class="li5">Changed the license the game is released under to the BSD license.

    <li class="li5">Removed the MazerPlatform plug-in and integrated its contents into the main code.

    <li class="li5">Finished the documentation for the plug-in system - plug-in developers can use this documentation to create their own plug-ins.

    <li class="li5">Split the Version History into two: Beta Version History documents the changes in beta builds, and the "normal" Version History documents the changes in full releases.

    <li class="li5">Barriers now hurt you for 2% of your max health if you try to cross them.

    <li class="li5">The game no longer prompts for a high score if the game ends because you ran out of health.

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Bug Fixes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug that made picking up objects on ground with special properties (such as water, slime, and lava) not work properly.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug that caused the rule that only one Player should exist on a level of a Maze at any one time to not always be enforced.

    <li class="li5">Fixed a bug causing the game to prompt for a high score when it shouldn't.

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Added two new commands to the Fill submenu of the Editor menu: <em>Fill Rule Sets...</em> and <em>Use Fill Rule Sets</em>. The first command invokes the new Rule Set Picker, used to define Rule Sets that modify random maze generation. The second command is a toggle that turns Rule Sets on or off.

  <p class="p5"><strong>V2.00 (02/16/2010):</strong>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Added a new command to the Editor menu: <em>Set Start Point...</em> - this command is an alternative to explicitly placing the player at the desired start location.

    <li class="li5">Added health to the game. Various objects affect your health. If you run out for any reason, the game ends.

    <li class="li5">Added a new maze preference to set the starting health.

    <li class="li5">Added thirty new objects: Signs, which display a message when walked into; Trees, which are impassable without an Axe; Axes, which are used to cut Trees; Cut Trees, the remnant stumps of Trees cut by Axes (which are passable); six kinds of squares that act as keys;  six kinds of Walls that require a variable number of corresponding squares to open (thus behaving similarly to other kinds of locks - the difference being that the squares are NOT removed from inventory when the lock is unlocked); nine kinds of potions, which affect your health in various ways; four new traps, which also affect health; and Heal Boots, which regenerate health slowly as you walk.

    <li class="li5">If you manage to shoot yourself with your own arrows, which can happen if the maze wraps horizontally or vertically, you'll get hurt a little. This damage is doubled if the arrow was enchanted.

  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Other Changes (All Platforms):</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Reduced the size of the music that comes with the game, at the cost of some quality.

    <li class="li5">Named the various threads the program creates while it runs. If one of these threads encounters a problem that generates an error log, the name of that thread will now be displayed in the log, instead of a generic name such as "Thread-6".
  </ul>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Other Changes (Mac OS X):</span>

  <p class="p5"><span class="s1">New Features:</span>

  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Initial Release.
  </ul>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Fantastle Version History</strong>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V5.00-dev5 (unreleased): Fixed a bug that made effects modifying Maximum HP or Maximum MP not work correctly. Added combat-usable items to the game.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V5.00-dev4 (10/31/2009): Fixed another crashing bug in the battle engine. Added a new Extras menu, with options to start earlier major versions of Fantastle, Dungeon Diver, and Maze Runner. All are embedded into the program, and can be invoked at any time. The embedded versions have had a few things changed, such as the removal of the update checker, and the removal of the GUI for any associated preferences for the update checker. All of the embedded programs have version numbers newer than the last release for that particular series - this is deliberate. Note that once one of the embedded programs has been invoked, the only way to return to Fantastle 5, or switch to a different embedded program, is to quit and re-launch the game. Removed the preference for hiding the Debug menu - it is now always visible. Added 2 new objects: Controllable Teleports and One-Shot Controllable Teleports.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V5.00-dev3 (10/24/2009): Emergency fix for a crashing bug that made V5.00-dev2 unplayable.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V5.00-dev2 (10/23/2009): Saved game format changed again, due to other additions. Revamped the item system - got rid of the old weapons and armor, and replaced them with 2 caste-specific weapon choices - one 1-handed, the other 2-handed - and 12 different kinds of armor, that are the same for all castes. It is now possible to equip two one-handed weapons at once, as well, but note: doing so forfeits your ability to equip a shield. Added music to the game, and a new set of preferences for controlling it. Changed the way monster names are generated: Now, any monster can appear at any level. Dramatically increased the level at which The Boss is encountered, from 13 to 60. Boosted the boss's bonus level relative to yours. Monsters now have equipment of their own (making the monsters a little tougher than they used to be). Added an equipment viewer to the Game menu. Unified the Show Inventory dialog so that it shows both objects and items in inventory, and made it consistent in style with the Use an Item… dialog. The contribution to defense rating by equipping armor is one-tenth of what it used to be; this is of course offset by the multiple varieties of armor now available. Adjusted the distribution of monster spells per level to reflect these changes. Changed the Inventory Dialog to show Regular Boots instead of Boots: None, when you aren't wearing any special boots.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V5.00-dev1 (10/16/2009): Changed the maze and saved game formats. Older mazes can be opened without conversion; older saved games cannot be opened or converted. Removed the entire Message section of the Preferences, and all the associated settings. All creatures (the player, monsters, and the boss) now have 6 new statistics. Added a bunch of support code to use these new statistics. Improved the battle engine: It is now possible to steal Gold from the enemy, or drain the enemy's MP. It is also possible for you and the enemy to act more than once per round. Redid the player attributes system: Got rid of the old Classes and replaced these with Races, Castes, Faiths, Genders, and Personalities. There are now 1,000,000 possible starting characters. Added a new Mobile Mode preference, which, when enabled, restricts window sizes to 320x480 and uses half-size graphics, intended to simulate use of Fantastle on a mobile device (iPod touch, smartphone, PDA, etc.). Added a new loading screen to address the long time for the game to start initially.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V4.40 (10/10/2009): Added support for cutting levels, inserting levels from the clipboard, and going to a specific location in the editor. Refactored the code internally.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V4.30 (10/04/2009): Modernized the maze loader. Added support for copying and pasting levels within the editor.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V4.20 (08/31/2009): Fixed several compatibility problems with Fantastle and Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6). Added the ability to resize levels, in addition to the existing add/remove level functionality. Added a meaningful error message for when an attempt to open a file fails because it's not a maze file.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V4.10 (08/28/2009): Renamed many objects. The letter keys and locks are now plugs and ports, and Rock is now Dirt, thanks to a user suggestion. Many objects also got graphical upgrades or tweaks, thanks again to a user suggestion. Rearranged the objects so that similar objects are together. Added support for the "WAXD" control scheme as an alternative to the numeric keypad, for users with keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad. See the manual for details on how the "WAXD" scheme works.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V4.00 (08/19/2009): Improved the user interface on all platforms. Fixed an old editor undo/redo bug that could cause objects to end up in places they shouldn't be. Fixed a battle bug that caused damage to be doubled unexpectedly. Added 16 new objects. Once more, the maze and saved game formats have changed. Just like the last time this happened, older mazes can be opened without conversion, but older saved games cannot. Cracked Walls and Bombs have been repurposed. All older mazes containing these objects will still work - Cracked Walls become Brick Walls, and Bombs become Hammers. Their functionality remains the same as before, despite the appearance and name changes. Additionally, the scores and preferences file formats changed in a backward-incompatible way. The game now remembers the last used folder for opening and saving. Removed some old bits of code that are no longer used. Fixed an old redraw bug and an effect scaling bug. Fixed 2 old editor bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V3.21 (06/11/2009): Fixed 5 bugs accidentally introduced in V3.20. Oops!

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V3.20 (06/06/2009): Restructured the code internally. Added weaker than normal hits to battles, as well as stronger than normal hits. Changed the message displayed when one of these hits occurs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V3.10 (05/21/2009): Fixed bugs. Added player and monster fumbles to battles. Made the updater a lot smarter.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V3.00 (05/17/2009): Added 45 new objects. Changed the maze and saved game formats again. Older mazes can be opened without conversion. Older saved games cannot be opened or converted. Merged Dungeon Diver's code into Fantastle, and enhanced it.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.10 (03/17/2009): Added the ability to add and remove levels while editing a maze.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.01 (03/12/2009): Fixed 5 bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.00 (03/07/2009): Added 119 new objects. Changed the maze and saved game formats. A converter is now supplied with the game to convert older mazes, but saved games cannot be converted. Removed the dynamic limits introduced in V0.80 beta and made them static instead.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.11 (01/10/2009): Fixed bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.10 (01/01/2009): Added 3 new options to the Game menu - Reset Current Level, Show Current Score, and Show Score Table. Fixed even more bugs. Added score tracking support - the game now tracks the number of steps taken to solve a maze, and displays the 10 lowest step scores. Reorganized the code internally. Changed the saved game format in such a way that the new format is 100% compatible with older versions of the game, and the old format 100% compatible with new versions.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.01 (12/27/2008): Fixed a few more bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.00 (12/18/2008): Added an About Dialog to the game. Fixed the last few remaining bugs. Created an installer for Windows users.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.80 beta (12/15/2008): Fixed an issue with large maze creation times. Imposed new limits on maze size to fix an issue that caused mazes near the memory limit to not work properly. The limits work like this: There is an absolute upper limit on all dimensions of 64. Additionally, floors and levels are subject to a more restrictive upper limit that is dependent on the rows and columns chosen. This limit shrinks with greater row/column dimensions. Upgraded a few graphics - the appearance of cracked walls, water, and sunken blocks has changed, hopefully for the better.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.71 beta (12/07/2008): Fixed many bugs. Made random teleports a lot less frustrating than they used to be - now they'll always send you somewhere the first try.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.70 beta (12/04/2008): Fixed bugs and reorganized the code internally. Added a new sound for when push attempts fail.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.60 beta (11/09/2008): Second beta release. Sound support added. Preferences interface revamped - now divided into four tabs. Many new preferences added for turning sound effects on and off. Many bugs fixed.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">Note to Mac OS X users: Due to a Mac OS X-specific bug in V0.50 beta, the extension of the preferences file has changed for Mac OS X users only, from plist to prefs. Your old preferences from V0.50 will NOT be automatically imported, because this bug caused the program to crash. However, you can export your preferences from V0.50 then import them into V0.60 to work around this bug.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.50 beta (11/01/2008): First beta release. All known bugs fixed. The program now comes with a Maze Runner maze converter that updates Maze Runner mazes to the new format.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.40 alpha: Fixed more bugs, added export/import support to preferences.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.30 alpha: Fixed bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.20 alpha: Fixed bugs, added updater feature.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V0.10 alpha: Took the Maze Runner V2.21 code base and completely overhauled it. This new code base is still fairly buggy.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5"><strong>Maze Runner Version History</strong>

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.21 (08/26/2007): Fixed a bug in the editor that caused placing objects not to work properly.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.20 (08/15/2007): Added undo and redo support to the editor. Added an option for clearing the undo/redo history to the Edit menu. Added a close command to the File menu. Removed the restriction preventing replaying a maze without reloading it - this also allows going into the editor and editing a maze right after playing it, as well as playing a maze as soon as it's been created in the editor. Somehow, I managed to break two-way teleporters in the editor in V2.10 - they're fixed now. Cleaned up the version history a bit. Made some internal changes that should minimize the chances of certain types of bugs rearing their ugly heads.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.10 (08/09/2007): Added menus to all screens. Removed the requirement to reload the maze after the graphics set or size is changed. Added the ability to change the graphics set and size, or any other preference, while playing or editing the maze, and made the program instantly reflect the new settings. Added a new menu - the Game menu - and two new menu items: Show Inventory and Use an Item. Added accelerator keys to all menu items except Exit. Removed the alternate key bindings introduced in V2.01 since they aren't needed anymore, and were responsible for several bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.01 (07/28/2007): Added alternative key bindings for Inventory, Save, and Use to the game and editor. Fixed an issue with the Mac OS X release where the menus weren't showing up in the Mac OS menu bar as they were supposed to.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V2.00 (06/30/2007): Added 18 new objects: Pits (dump the player, a pushable block, or a pushable/pullable block down one floor when walked on or a block is pushed into it - impassable on floor 1 but can be filled by pushing a block into one), Tile (a variety of ground that permits objects to be pushed and pulled over it), Pushable Blocks, Pullable Blocks, Pushable/Pullable Blocks, Ice (a frictionless object - anything that touches ice keeps moving until it hits something that isn't ice), Finish To... (a special exit that takes the player to a level other than the next one in the maze), Sunken Blocks (created by pushing blocks into water - can be walked on and have objects pushed and pulled over them), Water (normally impassable, but can be walked on if the Water-Walking Boots are in your inventory), Water-Walking Boots (permit walking on water), Annihilation Wand (destroys anything except the Void), Finish-Making Wand, Wall-Making Wand, Energy Sphere (permits walking on force fields), Force Field (normally impassable unless an Energy Sphere is in your inventory), Teleport Wand (acts like a teleporter when used, but you can control the destination), Void (surrounds the maze now, instead of walls, and is completely indestructible - it is immune to all wand effects; additionally, appears in the game as a Sealing Wall if next to anything other than other Void squares), and Exploding Walls (explode when touched, causing other exploding walls next to it to also explode). Completely overhauled the graphics - there are two new sets now, instead of the "Default" set that older versions had, called Modern and Classic. Added multi-level support - now mazes with multiple levels can act as several distinct mazes, each with its own start and finish. If a Finish To... is used to send the player to a level they have already completed, that level will be restored to a pristine state. Made a major change to the saved game format, completely breaking backward compatibility with older saved games. Older mazes, though, still work. Fixed many, many bugs.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.40 (06/13/2007): Added 1 new object - two-way teleporter (behaves in pairs, just like stairs) - and fixed several bugs. Added a status bar at the bottom for displaying in- game and in-editor messages. Added color graphics (this was present in V1.30 also, but never documented). Turned the "Can't go that way" message on by default again.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.30 (06/09/2007): Added 6 new objects: stairs up, stairs down (stairs behave in pairs), and 4 kinds of one-way wall. Fixed a bug in the editor that caused the coordinates to place an object to not be computed properly.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.20 (05/11/2007): Added 6 new kinds of teleporter - random, random invisible, one- shot, invisible one-shot, random one-shot, and random invisible one-shot; teleporter destinations are now set by clicking on the location for the teleporter to teleport to; added the ability to go back to the menu after solving a maze or editing a maze; changed message displayed when the player attempts to move outside the maze to "Can't go that way" and turned that message off by default; added a check for the current maze or game needing to be saved, and a prompt for the user to save or not; fixed numerous bugs. 

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.11 (05/07/2007): Fixed a bug in the editor.

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.10 (05/04/2007): Improved user interface. Added preferences dialog. 

  <p class="p6"><br>

  <p class="p5">V1.00 (05/02/2007): Initial Release.
