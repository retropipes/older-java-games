ALWAYS include the version of MazeRunnerII that you have.  A lot of things change, and without the version number it is pretty tough to verify the problem.  Please try to be as specific as possible.  A comment such as, "It crashes all the time," is too vague, and will not be of any real value in correcting the problem. Try to describe where you were and what you were doing, along with your system configuration, and the log file containing details of the crash, if MazeRunnerII crashed. Mac OS X users can use System Profiler, in the Utilities folder, to generate a system report of their system configuration.\

\i\b \cf0 Game Objective\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\i0\b0 \cf0 The overall goal of the game is to find either all the Sun Stones or all the Moon Stones for the particular Maze being solved, or to find and enter the finish for the particular Maze being solved. Since you can make your own Mazes, the exact way this is accomplished differs from Maze to Maze.\

\i Game
\i0 ,
\i  Editor, Media, 
\i0 and 
\i Misc
\i0 . 
\i Game, Editor,

\i0  are for Game-related, Editor-related, and music/sound-related settings, respectively. The 
\i Misc.
\i0  tab has two settings: whether or not to check for updated versions when the Game is started, and whether changes to the state of characters are permanent or temporary.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Starting A New Adventure\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
To start a new adventure, simply choose Play from the Game menu. The maze will be built, after the members of your adventuring party are chosen; this process is explained below.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 How to Assemble Your Party\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
Upon starting a new adventure, you'll be asked to create or pick characters for your party. The Pick option will only be offered if some characters already exist. The maximum number of characters that can be in your party is 1.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Main Screen\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
At the top, just below the window border, is the message area. When there is something to display, it shows up there. On the right side is the statistics display. The items shown are, from top to bottom: Health, Magic, Gold, Attack, Defense, Experience, and Monster Level. In the center is the Maze itself. You are located in the center at all times.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Game Controls\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
To move, use the arrow keys \'96 Up, Down, Left, and Right. You can also use the Numeric Keypad (make sure Num Lock is enabled), or the so-called "WAXD" configuration: W moves up, A moves left, D moves right, and X moves down. Additionally, diagonal movement is supported with WAXD: Q moves up and left, E moves up and right, Z moves down and left, C moves down and right. If you wish to move diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or the WAXD layout are the only ways to do this. Shift+Click an object to identify it. Its name will be displayed in the Message Area. If, for some reason, you need to make a "pass move" - that is, a do-nothing move, pressing 5 on the Numeric Keypad or the S key achieves this.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Line of Sight\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 Only objects that are not blocked from view by walls, or that you have seen already are visible to you, if the vision mode settings are at their defaults. Keep this in mind when exploring Mazes.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Pushing and Pulling\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To push an Object, just move into it. It will also move, if it can. To pull an Object, hold Shift and move AWAY from it. It will follow you, if it can be pulled.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Seeing what you are carrying\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To see what Items (if any) you have in your possession, choose 
\i Show Inventory
\i0  from the 
\i Game
\i0  menu. A dialog box will appear, listing everything you can carry and what quantity you have.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Your Health\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 In addition to simply trying to find the exit, managing your Health must be done as well. Should you run out for any reason, your game will end. Many things affect your Health, both good and bad. Worse still, the very air in these Mazes is poisonous. The poison will slowly weaken you as you walk around the maze. Its power is displayed in the stats area at the top. If the poison power is None, then there is no poison. Otherwise, it is displayed in units of health taken away per number of steps.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Time Limits\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 There may be a time limit, measured in steps, for how long you can take to solve this Level of this Maze. If time runs out, the Level will be automatically solved, and you'll be sent to the next one, as usual.\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 \
Shooting Arrows\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To shoot, hold down Alt/Option then use the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, and Right, use the Numeric Keypad, or the WAXD layout. If you wish to shoot diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or WAXD are the only ways to do this. Various Objects react to getting hit by arrows. You have an unlimited supply of regular arrows. Be careful - if you accidentally shoot yourself with your own arrows, you'll suffer a little damage. This damage is doubled for enchanted arrows.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Shooting Enchanted Arrows\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 First, activate the enchanted bow you wish to use by choosing 
\i Switch Bow\'85
\i0  from the Game menu. Arrows you shoot will come from the bow you just activated, until you switch again or run out of arrows. Enchanted bows only come with a limited arrow supply, unlike your regular bow.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Using Items you are carrying\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To use something you\'92re carrying that can be explicitly used (such as a Wand), choose 
\i Use an Item...
\i0  from the 
\i Game 
\i0 Menu. This will bring up a dialog listing what usable Items you have, as well as their quantities and uses - choose which one to use and click the 
\i OK
\i0  button. A prompt will appear in the Message Area at the top: \'93
\i Click to set target
\i0 \'94. Click the square in the Maze where you wish the Item\'92s effect to occur, and it will be activated. If you realize you didn\'92t want to use something after all, press 
\i Escape
\i0 , and the action will be cancelled. If you try to use an Item but fail (for example, because the requirements for the target square were not met), a message will appear in the Message Area indicating what went wrong. Not all Items can be explicitly used in this way. Items that show up in the Inventory Dialog but not in the Use Dialog are used automatically when needed.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Effects\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 Various Objects in the Maze give effects when stepped on or picked up. These effects, along with their durations, will be displayed in the bottom pane. If no effects are currently active, the bottom pane will be collapsed. Effects can be either beneficial or detrimental.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Getting Help\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To find out what all the Objects do, choose 
\i MazeRunnerII Help
\i0  from the 
\i Help
\i0  menu. This will bring up a window that you can leave open while playing the game, listing each object and a short description of how it works.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Controls in the Maze Editor\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural
\cf0 \ulnone Moving Around and Identifying Objects\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To move the view around, drag the scroll bars on the left. To see more Objects to place, drag the scroll bars on the right. To change Floors and/or Levels, use the 
\i Up One Floor
\i0 , 
\i Up One Level
\i0 , 
\i Down One Floor
\i0 , and 
\i Down One Level
\i0  items in the 
\i Editor
\i0  menu. Shift+Click an object in the maze to identify it. Its name, along with any additional properties it has and the values of those properties, will be displayed in the Message Area.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Placing Objects\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To place an Object, first select one in the right pane. Then, click the location in the Maze where you want the Object to go. If you need to change layers in order to place Objects, this can be done via the 
\i Toggle Layer
\i0  option in the Editor menu. You can also drag the mouse after selecting an object to \'93paint\'94 it in the Maze multiple times, wherever you want it.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Modifying The Maze Dimensions\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 Mazes can gain or lose Levels as they are edited. To add a new Level to a Maze, choose 
\i Add a Level...
\i0  from the 
\i Edit
\i0  menu. You will be prompted for the dimensions of the new Level. Likewise, removing Levels can be accomplished via the 
\i Remove a Level...
\i0  item in the Edit menu. You\'92ll be prompted for the Level number to remove. Note that if you remove the current Level, you\'92ll be sent to Level 1. The active Level can be resized, too - via the 
\i Resize Current Level\'85
\i0  option in the Editor menu. Note that resizing a Level affects ALL Floors of that Level.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Setting Object Properties\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To set the properties of an Object, if it has any, hold the Option (or Alt) key and click the Object in the Maze Pane on the left. If it has properties you can set, a dialog or a message will appear. If it has no properties, the message \'93
\i This object has no properties
\i0 \'94 will appear in the Message Area. Most Teleports will generate a message that says \'93
\i Click to set destination
\i0 \'94 - this is exactly like using an Item. Click the spot where you want the destination to be. If you\'92d like the destination to be on a Floor other than the current one, you can change Floors before clicking. Random Teleports will generate a dialog asking for the Random Row and Column radii. Pressing 
\i Escape
\i0  will cancel setting properties.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Setting Maze and Level Preferences\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 To set preferences for a Level, or the entire Maze, select the 
\i Level Preferences\'85 
\i0 or 
\i Maze Preferences\'85
\i0  commands from the Editor menu, as appropriate. Levels have several settings, including wraparound, a title, messages, and vision mode. Mazes also have several settings, including the Level to start at, a title, and messages.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Defining Rule Sets\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 Rule Sets influence how the random Maze generator generates mazes. They are managed from the Rule Set Picker. To use the Rule Set Picker, select an Object to work with from the pick list, then click the button for the action desired. Five actions are defined: Create, Destroy, Edit, Load, and Save. Load and Save operate on the entire set, while Create, Destroy, and Edit operate on individual rules. Rules can specify various restrictions on how many Objects should be generated of a specific type, and can also make the Object the Rule acts on required or not required.\

\b \cf0 Character Prestige\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
As your character performs deeds both courageous and cowardly, their prestige will change.  This is a score based on many different factors, such as the amount of enemies they have killed or how often they are hit themselves.\
\
Things such as getting killed, missing in battle or failing to resist spells in battle can all affect your prestige in a negative way.\
\

\b \cf2 RED
\b0 \cf0  hurt your prestige, whereas

\
Positive Prestige Points are calculated:\
\
+ (Damage Given - Damage Taken) / 10 (This could be negative)\
+ Hits Given\
+ Attacks Dodged\
+ 2 x Enemies Killed\
\
Negative Prestige Points are calculated:\
\

\b \cf0 Gaining Levels\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

Defeating monsters in battle is the primary way of earning experience towards the next level. Any experience earned will be divided as evenly as possible between the members of your party who are still alive and conscious and have not fled from battle.\

\b \cf0 Battle\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 Battle is fought on a separate and randomly generated Maze, which is much smaller than the main Maze. Battle in MazeRunnerII is turn-based, which means that each creature involved in the battle gets a turn to act, until everyone has acted. Once that happens, a new round begins, and the cycle restarts anew. Battle ends once all hostile creatures are defeated, or your party is defeated.\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 \
Battle Special Actions\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
Pressing and holding the Shift key, then attempting to move when it is your turn in battle, will cause you to fire an arrow instead of moving. Arrows never miss, are considerably weaker than melee weapons, and follow faith rules when determining the damage done. Arrows never critically hit, and ignore enemy defenses when computing damage.\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 \
Battle Maze\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b0 \cf0 \
As with the Maze, the active character, which may not be you if one of the monsters is acting, is in the center. The message area at the top behaves in exactly the same way as the Maze version, as does the statistics display on the right.\
\
\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Using Weapons to Attack\
\

\b0 \cf0 \
Different things may happen when you attack an enemy in battle with your weapon.\
\
Critical Hit: Occurs 20% of the time, deals double damage.\
Piercing Hit: Occurs 10% of the time, ignores enemy defense when calculating damage.\
Fumble: Occurs 5% of the time, damages the attacker with their own weapon.\
\
It is possible for the first two events to occur at the same time. Both your party and the enemies can perform these actions.\

\pard\pardeftab709\pardirnatural

\b \cf0 Running Away\

\b \cf0 Attacking A Friendly Character\
\

\b \cf0 Blessing: 
\b0 Getting this on your equipment increases its effectiveness. Blessed items will have a +X suffix attached to them, where X is the number of times it has been blessed.

\b \cf0 Faith Power: 
\b0 Getting this on your equipment increases its effectiveness also.

Faith Powers do NOT increase the power of the item they are applied to. Faith Powers increase in cost as more are applied, and cannot be applied more than 9 times to a single item.

\b0  text in the formula represents the part to be evaluated next.\
\
Example 1: Bamboo Stick -9 has power 1\
Looking up Bamboo in the material table gives 1\
Formula: (
\b 1 + 0
\b0 ) 
\b \'d7
\b0  10 - 9\
Simplifies to: 
\b 1 \'d7 10
\b0  - 9\
Simplifies to: 
\b 10 - 9
\b0 \
Final Answer: 1\
\
Example 2: Rare Magic Axe +9 has power 999\
Looking up Magic in the material table gives 97\
Looking up Rare in the prefix table gives 2\
Formula: (
\b 97 + 2
\b0 ) 
\b \'d7
\b0  10 + 9\
Simplifies to: 
\b 99 \'d7 10
\b0  + 9\
Simplifies to: 
\b 990 + 9
\b0 \
Final Answer: 999\
\
Weapon Base (Maximum) Damage = Power (ignoring Bonus) / 10 (integer)\
Weapon Bonus (Minimum and Maximum) Damage = Bonus (integer)\
Armor % Damage Reduction = Power / 10 (floating-point)\
Minimum % DR = 0 (no armor equipped)\
Maximum % DR = 99.9 (999 / 10)\
\

\i Note 1
\i0 : Weapon minimum damage is 1, unless modified by a Bonus.
\i \
Note 2
\i0 : Damage cannot be reduced below 1 by Damage Reduction.\
