== Adventure Maker's Guide for Version 3 ==

Adventure files are plain text files, with a .tap extension, in the format
described below.

Basic command syntax:

[room name]
room description
command1=result
command2=[special arg]

All adventure files must have a room called main. This room must have a command
called start, whose result must be the name of a room - this room will be where
gameplay begins. The main room must also have as the first line after the room
name, a welcome message for the entire adventure (which can be blank).

An example:

[main]
Welcome to Tutorial!
start=square

[square]
... rest of adventure file goes here ...

Rooms can also have commands that trigger a special result. There are 2 such
commands:

command3=[warp square]

and

command4=[kill A message to display when the player dies]

The warp command takes as its only argument the name of the room to warp to.
The kill command terminates the adventure and displays the message following.
Inventory is supported too.

An example may help clarify:

[main]
Welcome to Inventory Test!
start=triangle

[triangle]
... rest of adventure file goes here ...

A new omni-command - show items - is available (this command works no matter
what room you are in, and displays the contents of your inventory).

There are also two special commands for managing inventory:

command5=[grab the name of an item]
Text to display when the player does NOT have the item
Text to display when the player has the item already

command6=[have the name of an item]
=Text to display, or a special command to run when the player does NOT have it
=Text to display, or a special command to run when the player has it

The grab command adds an item to your inventory, if you don't have it already.
The have command is used for branching on whether or not an item is in inventory.
Have commands can NOT be nested. The = signs before any text or special commands
are required. The special command can be any other non-inventory-related command,
or the gain, lose, or oncegain commands.

Command results can be chained together, in order to do more than one thing in a
command line. Command results to be chained together are separated with
" && " (without the "quotes"). Command result chains may be used anywhere a result
is required.

Another example:

[main]
Welcome to Chain Test!
start=circle

[circle]
tryme=This is some text to chain. && This is a second line of text.
... rest of adventure file goes here ...

The grab and have commands can also take multiple items as an argument, separated
by " & " (without the "quotes"). This tells the parser to proceed only if ALL items
named are present in inventory, and fails the test otherwise, in the case of a
have command. Grab commands work differently with this enhancement: instead of
failing if ANY of the items could not be grabbed, they fail only if NONE of the
items named could be grabbed.

In addition to that, two more commands for working with inventory have been added:
the drop and lose commands. Multiple items can be listed in a drop or lose command
by separating each one with " & ", just like grab and have commands. Drop and lose
commands succeed if ALL named items are present in inventory, and fail otherwise -
much like how have commands work. Drop commands also have two messages following
them, just like grab commands do. The first one is displayed if the drop succeeds.
The second is displayed if the drop fails. If the drop or lose succeeds, ALL listed
items are removed from inventory. Unlike drop commands, lose commands do not
display any messages upon success or failure - they just remove the item(s) from
your inventory - and are therefore safe to use in have command results.

An example:
[main]
Welcome to Drop Test!
start=getstuff

[getstuff]
This room has stuff in it.
take stuff=[grab trash can & garbage & cover]
You take the three items.
You already have the stuff.
put stuff back=[drop trash can & garbage & cover]
You put the three items back where you found them.
You don't have the stuff you're trying to put back.
discard stuff=[lose trash can & garbage & cover]
... rest of adventure file goes here ...

The oncegrab, oncegain, and gain commands are also supported for managing inventory.
Multiple items can be listed in any of these commands by separating each one with
" & ", just like the grab command. Oncegrab and oncegain commands succeed if ALL
named items are present in inventory AND have not already been grabbed, and fail
otherwise - much like how grab commands work, except that you can only grab the
item(s) one time - even if you lose them later. Gain commands succeed if the items
gained are NOT already present in inventory, and fail otherwise - just like grab
commands. Oncegrab commands also have two messages following them, just like grab
commands do. The first one is displayed if the grab succeeds. The second is
displayed if the grab fails. Gain and oncegain commands do NOT have messages after
them, unlike oncegrab.

An example for oncegrab:

[main]
Welcome to Grab Once Test!
start=getstuff

[getstuff]
This room has stuff in it.
take stuff=[oncegrab trash can & garbage & cover]
You take the three items.
You already took the stuff, and cannot take it again.
put stuff back=[drop trash can & garbage & cover]
You put the three items back where you found them.
You don't have the stuff you're trying to put back.
discard stuff=[lose trash can & garbage & cover]

Input stripping will be performed next, before any command processing takes place.
The words that are stripped from the user's input are "a", "an", and "the".

Synonym substitution will be performed after input stripping, but before any command
processing takes place. The words that are substituted in the user's input are
determined by a synonym table, located in a room whose name is the value of a
command in the main room called "syntab". The synonym table's format is like this:
[synonym table name]

keyword1, synonym1, synonym2, ...
keyword2, synonym1, synonym2, ...
...

That blank line after the synonym table name is important. If it is omitted, the
first line of the synonym table will not be parsed.

If the syntab= entry is omitted from the main room, synonym substitution will not
be performed.

An example will help clarify:

[main]
Welcome to Synonym Test!
start=testing room
syntab=synonyms

[synonyms]

north, n
south, s
west, w
east, e

[testing room]
This is a test room.
north=You look to the north, but nothing is there.
south=You look to the south, but nothing is there.
east=You look to the east, but nothing is there.
west=You look to the west, but nothing is there.
... rest of adventure file goes here ...

The keywords are substituted for anything else in the same line in the table. If
the user types "n", the game will understand this to mean "north", by looking up
"n" in the synonym table.

Compound commands will be understood by the input parser as a chain of commands
separated by "and" or "then", and will be executed in the order entered.

Objects whose state needs to be tracked, but are not in inventory, can
now be done via the new commands check and alter.

The alter command modifies the state of an object, adding it to the list if it
does not exist already. The check command behaves very much like the have command
does for inventory, except that it works with object states, instead. The alter 
command supports modifying multiple objects at once - list each object then its
new state, in pairs separated with spaces. Note that the = signs are REQUIRED
for both results of a check command.

An example:

[main]
Welcome to Object State Test!
start=statetest

[statetest]
This room has various objects in it.
open chest=[alter chest open] && You open the chest.
close chest=[alter chest closed] && You close the chest.
take chest=[check chest open]
=What do you think you're doing, taking an open chest with you?
=The chest is too heavy to take, even when closed.
