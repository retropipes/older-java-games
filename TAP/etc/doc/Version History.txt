== Version History ==

V3.0.0 (04/15/2011): Removed all the flags, which are now always turned on.
Removed TAP2 support, as it is no longer needed. Added new commands to
manipulate and check the state of objects not in inventory. Made the parser
handle syntax errors better by giving more helpful feedback.

V2.0.0 (09/06/2010): Added support for a new extension - TAP2. Such files have
all flags defined in the version 1.X.Y series turned on by default. Older files
still work without modification.

V1.6.0 (08/30/2010): Added support for complex command input - meaning a
sequence of commands separated by "and" or "then". Each command in the sequence
will be executed in entry order. A new flag has been added to enable this feature.

V1.5.0 (08/24/2010): Added support for substitution of synonyms via a new
flag and a per-adventure synonym table.

V1.4.0 (08/19/2010): Added support for stripping input of words that hinder
the parser with a new flag.

V1.3.0 (08/15/2010): Added support for three new inventory commands: gain
(like grab but without messages), oncegrab (like grab but only works once),
and oncegain (oncegrab and gain put together).

V1.2.0 (08/12/2010): Added support for testing for the presence of multiple
items in a have command by splitting each item to test for with " & ". Added
support for grabbing multiple items at once with a grab command by separating
each item to grab with " & ". Have tests fail if ALL of the listed items are
not present, while grabs only fail if NONE of the items could be grabbed.
Cleaned up the code a bit. Fixed the game's website in the about dialog.

V1.1.0 (08/10/2010): Added command chaining support. The game no longer prints
"You are in room name" when you enter a room. The game no longer clears the
output when warping to another room. Fixed a parser bug causing commands shorter
than 4 letters to crash with a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Fixed a file
reading bug that caused the file to never be closed. Fixed various other parser
issues.

V1.0.0 (08/09/2010): Initial Release.
