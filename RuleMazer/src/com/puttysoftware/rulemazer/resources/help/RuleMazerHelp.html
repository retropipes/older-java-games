Since you can make your own Mazes, the exact way this is accomplished differs from Maze to Maze.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P3">Term Definitions</p><p class="P4">Rows and Columns refer to the horizontal and vertical lines of squares making up the Maze Grid. Floors are stacks of Row/Column Grids. Levels are stacks of Floors. Finally, every Maze has 2 Layers - the Ground Layer (where Grass, Tile, and other types of ground belong) and the Object Layer (where everything else belongs). Levels in a Mazer5D maze file are treated as distinct Mazes in their own right, with individual start points and finishes.</p><p class="P7"> </p><p class="P3">Menu Overview</p><p class="P6">File</p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">New</span><span class="T1">: Creates a new Maze. You can specify its dimensions. Rows and Columns cannot be less than 2 squares nor greater than 64 squares, and Floors not less than 1 nor greater than 64. A new Maze always starts with 1 Level - more can be added later.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Open…</span><span class="T1">: Opens an existing Maze.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Open Locked…</span><span class="T4">: Opens an existing Maze that has been locked with the </span><span class="T2">Save Locked...</span><span class="T4"> command.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Close</span><span class="T1">: Closes the current Mode Window (Game or Editor, not the current Maze).</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Save</span><span class="T1">: Saves the current Maze.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Save As</span><span class="T1">: Saves the current Maze with a new name.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Save Locked...</span><span class="T1">: Saves a locked copy of the current Maze.

This command only works on objects with fixed destinations, such as Teleports, Invisible Teleports, One-Shot Teleports, and Invisible One-Shot Teleports. Invoking it on an object with a variable destination, such as a set of stairs, any of the Random Teleports, a Pit, or a Springboard, will not work.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Up One Floor</span><span class="T1">, </span><span class="T2">Down One Floor</span><span class="T1">, </span><span class="T2">Up One Level</span><span class="T1">, </span><span class="T2">Down One Level, Add a Level..., Remove a Level...</span><span class="T1">: All these commands work only in the Editor, and are self-explanatory.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Resize Current Level</span><span class="T1">: Changes the size of the active Level within the active Maze.

For instance, the MazeRunner.5de plugin in the Plugin Pack can be registered by simply selecting the </span><span class="T3">MazeRunner</span><span class="T1"> option at the Register Plugin prompt. It will then be automatically loaded.</span></p><p class="P7"> </p><p class="P3">Controls in the Game</p><p class="P6">Moving Around and Identifying Objects</p><p class="P4">To move, use the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, and Right. You can also use the Numeric Keypad, or the so-called "WAXD" configuration: W moves up, A moves left, D moves right, and X moves down. Additionally, diagonal movement is supported with WAXD: Q moves up and left, E moves up and right, Z moves down and left, C moves down and right. If you wish to move diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or the WAXD layout are the only ways to do this. Shift+Click an object to identify it. Its name will be displayed in the Message Area. If, for some reason, you need to make a "pass move" - that is, a do-nothing move, pressing 5 on the Numeric Keypad or the S key achieves this.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Your Health</p><p class="P4">In addition to simply trying to find the exit, managing your Health must be done as well. Should you run out for any reason, your game will end. Many things affect your Health, both good and bad. Worse still, the very air in these Mazes is poisonous. The poison will slowly weaken you as you walk around the maze. Its power is displayed in the stats area at the top. If the poison power is None, then there is no poison. Otherwise, it is displayed in units of health taken away per number of steps.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Time Limits</p><p class="P4">There may be a time limit, measured in steps, for how long you can take to solve this Level of this Maze. If time runs out, the Level will be automatically solved, and you'll be sent to the next one, as usual.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6">Shooting Arrows</p><p class="P4">To shoot, hold down Alt/Option then use the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, and Right, use the Numeric Keypad, or the WAXD layout. If you wish to shoot diagonally, the Numeric Keypad or WAXD are the only ways to do this. Various Objects react to getting hit by arrows. You have an unlimited supply of regular arrows. Be careful - if you accidentally shoot yourself with your own arrows, you'll suffer a little damage. This damage is doubled for enchanted arrows.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Shooting Enchanted Arrows</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">First, activate the enchanted bow you wish to use by choosing </span><span class="T2">Switch Bow…</span><span class="T1"> from the Game menu. Arrows you shoot will come from the bow you just activated, until you switch again or run out of arrows. Enchanted bows only come with a limited arrow supply, unlike your regular bow.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Pushing and Pulling</p><p class="P4">To push an Object, just move into it. It will also move, if it can. To pull an Object, hold Shift and move AWAY from it. It will follow you, if it can be pulled.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Seeing what you are carrying</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To see what Items (if any) you have in your possession, choose </span><span class="T2">Show Inventory</span><span class="T1"> from the </span><span class="T2">Game</span><span class="T1"> menu. A dialog box will appear, listing everything you can carry and what quantity you have.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Using Items you are carrying</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To use something you’re carrying that can be explicitly used (such as a Wand), choose </span><span class="T2">Use an Item...</span><span class="T1"> from the </span><span class="T2">Game </span><span class="T1">Menu. This will bring up a </span><span class="T1">dialog listing what usable Items you have, as well as their quantities and uses - choose which one to use and click the </span><span class="T2">OK</span><span class="T1"> button. A prompt will appear in the Message Area at the top: “</span><span class="T2">Click to set target</span><span class="T1">”. Click the </span><span class="T1">square in the Maze where you wish the Item’s effect to occur, and it will be activated. If you realize you didn’t want to use something after all, press </span><span class="T2">Escape</span><span class="T1">, and the action will be cancelled. If you try to use an Item but fail </span><span class="T1">(for example, because the requirements for the target square were not </span><span class="T1">met), a message will appear in the Message Area indicating what went </span><span class="T1">wrong.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">Not all Items can be explicitly used in this way. Items that show up in the Inventory Dialog but not in the Use Dialog are used automatically when needed.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Effects</p><p class="P4">Various Objects in the Maze give effects when stepped on or picked up. These effects, along with their durations, will be displayed in the bottom pane. If no effects are currently active, the bottom pane will be collapsed. Effects can be either beneficial or detrimental.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Getting Help</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To find out what all the Objects do, choose </span><span class="T2">Mazer5D Object Help</span><span class="T1"> from the </span><span class="T2">Help</span><span class="T1"> menu. This will bring up a window that you can leave open while playing the game, listing each object and a short description of how it works. This manual can also be invoked in the game at any time, by choosing </span><span class="T2">Mazer5D Help</span><span class="T1"> from the </span><span class="T2">Help</span><span class="T1"> menu.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P3">Controls in the Editor</p><p class="P6">Moving Around and Identifying Objects</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To move the view around, drag the scroll bars on the left. To see more Objects to place, drag the scroll bars on the right. To change Floors and/or Levels, use the </span><span class="T2">Up One Floor</span><span class="T1">, </span><span class="T2">Up One Level</span><span class="T1">, </span><span class="T2">Down One Floor</span><span class="T1">, and </span><span class="T2">Down One Level</span><span class="T1"> items in the </span><span class="T2">Edit</span><span class="T1"> menu. Shift+Click an object in the maze to identify it. Its name, along with any additional properties it has and the values of those properties, will be displayed in the Message Area.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Placing Objects</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To place an Object, first select one in the right pane. Then, click the location in the Maze where you want the Object to go. If you need to change layers in order to place Objects, this can be done via the </span><span class="T2">Toggle </span><span class="T2">Layer</span><span class="T1"> option in the Editor menu.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Modifying The Maze Dimensions</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Mazes can gain or lose Levels as they are edited. To add a new Level to a </span><span class="T1">Maze, choose </span><span class="T2">Add a Level...</span><span class="T1"> from the </span><span class="T2">Edit</span><span class="T1"> menu. You will be prompted for </span><span class="T1">the dimensions of the new Level. Likewise, removing Levels can be accomplished via the </span><span class="T2">Remove a Level...</span><span class="T1"> item in the Edit menu. You’ll be prompted for the Level number to remove. Note that if you remove the current Level, you’ll be sent to Level 1. The active Level can be resized, too - via the </span><span class="T2">Resize Current Level…</span><span class="T1"> option in the Editor menu. Note that resizing a Level affects ALL Floors of that Level.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Setting Object Properties</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To set the properties of an Object, if it has any, hold the Option (or Alt) key and click the Object in the Maze Pane on the left. If it has properties you can set, a dialog or a message will appear. If it has no properties, the message “</span><span class="T2">This object has no properties</span><span class="T1">” will appear in the Message Area. Most Teleports will generate a message that says “</span><span class="T2">Click to set destination</span><span class="T1">” - this is exactly like using an Item. Click the spot where you want the destination to be. If you’d like the destination to be on a Floor other than the current one, you can change Floors before clicking. Random Teleports will generate a dialog asking for the Random Row and Column radii. Pressing </span><span class="T2">Escape</span><span class="T1"> will cancel setting properties.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Setting Maze and Level Preferences</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">To set preferences for a Level, or the entire Maze, select the </span><span class="T2">Level Preferences… </span><span class="T1">or </span><span class="T2">Maze Preferences…</span><span class="T1"> commands from the Editor menu, as appropriate. Levels have several settings, including wraparound, a title, messages, poison power, and a time limit. Mazes also have several settings, including the Level to start at, a title, and messages.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P6">Defining Rule Sets</p><p class="P4">Rule Sets influence how the random Maze generator generates mazes. They are managed from the Rule Set Picker. To use the Rule Set Picker, select an Object to work with from the pick list, then click the button for the action desired. Five actions are defined: Create, Destroy, Edit, Load, and Save. Load and Save operate on the entire set, while Create, Destroy, and Edit operate on individual rules. Rules can specify various restrictions on how many Objects should be generated of a specific type, and can also make the Object the Rule acts on required or not required.</p></body></html>
